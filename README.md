# Work in Progress
1. Curvature is not symmetrical
2. Not framed with CRT monitor
3. Text is distorted due to curvature
4. Sides do not curve in aggressively enough
5. Highlighting with cursor does not match the text position
6. Not responsive

Ideas: SVG
1. Text is interactable
2. Styling is not as clean. (Curvature will cause distortions)

Ideas: WebGL & ThreeJS
1. Gives a nice smooth curve and doesn't overly distort text like SVG.
2. Text cannot be selected or highlighted.
